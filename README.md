# No-End-Flash
Simple mod for delete End Flash (purple lightning in any time) 

## P.S
I was really annoyed by the new "End Flash" mechanic in 1.21.9+, every ~10 second the End would shift into purple hues, and a bright flash appeared in the sk. So i made a small mod that removes this visual effect entirely, restoring the classic End atmosphere.

### P.S.S

During development, i realized that in minecraft`s "accessibility" settings, most of the effects from End Flash can simply be turned off. Therefore, the mod will not be released on any platforms and will just gather on this repo...
